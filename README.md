# Configuration files for Arch Linux

This is my `.config` directory, stored in Github as a backup for my local configuration in **Arch Linux**. Be careful and **use with knowledge**, since it can potentially disrupt the configuration of your local computer. The installation requires cloning the entire repository in your home directory and creating symbolic links to different locations where the programs are supposed to be.

> **_NOTE:_** If requested I might prepare in the future an `install.sh` file which will do this automatically by simply executing the command in your terminal when located in the home directory.

In case you want to delve further into the world of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) to write documents using LaTeX, I recommend the Github page of [Benjamin Brast-McKie](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config) where I originally discovered the possibility of using `NeoVim` as a LaTeX editor. There is plenty of information you can (and probably should) follow in order to start with the process. Another extremelly important resources I discovered are the webpages from [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) and [Elijan Mastnak](https://github.com/ejmastnak/ejmastnak.com). Here it is assumed you already have knowledge of both LaTeX and Vim, as well as using any terminal shell to move around things, edit them, install system packages, etc.

These last two are particularly oriented towards LaTeX in `Vim/NeoVim` for people which need to write documents with a strong mathematical background, mostly mathematicians, physicists and engineers. Since my current configuration is a combination of the things I have learned up to this day, which satisfies my personal preferences and necessities, the optimal way to procede in my opinion is to simply stick with one original resource you may find which explains how to start your own configuration. Only then you should visit more advanced resources like the two last ones.

To learn the basics of `Vim` commands and philosophy, the interactive webpage of [Interactive Vim Tutorial](https://www.openvim.com) is pretty good in my opinion.

That said, have fun and enjoy the world of `NeoVim`!
